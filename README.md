**Overview of Lustra**

---

### 🌟 **Lustra: A Radiant Language of Expression**

**Lustra** is a high-level, expressive programming language designed to blend *readability, elegance,* and *power* — compiling seamlessly into C++ for maximum performance. With a syntax that feels like writing intent rather than code, Lustra is ideal for creators who value clarity, artistry, and control.

---

### 🔧 **Core Features**

- **Python-like Simplicity** — Inspired by Python and pseudocode, with intuitive `let`, `func`, and `print` syntax.
- **Strong Typing (Optional)** — Choose between type inference or explicit declarations (`let name = "Lustra"` or `let count: Int = 5`).
- **Modern Control Flow** — Clean `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, and `while` syntax with arrow-based blocks (`=>`), closed with `end`.
- **Class & Function Support** — Easy function declarations with optional return types. Classes and methods coming soon.
- **Logical Expression Clarity** — Supports `and`, `or`, `not`, nested conditions, and block expressions.
- **Seamless C++ Compilation** — Translates directly into efficient, compilable C++ code.
- **Minimal Boilerplate** — Focus on what you mean; Lustra handles the scaffolding.

### 💡 **Sample Lustra Code**

```lustra
func greet(name: String): String =>
    if name == "Lustra" =>
        return "Welcome, shining one."
    else =>
        return "Hello, " + name
    end
end

let message = greet("Lustra")
print(message)
```

Compiles to clean, ready-to-run C++ with no effort on your part.

### 🪞 **Philosophy**

Lustra is named after **"luster"** — a radiant shine, a gleam of clarity. It's built on the belief that *code should feel like storytelling*, *execution should be lightning-fast*, and *tools should empower, not overwhelm*.
